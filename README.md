# Credit Risk Prediction System (Machine Learning)

## Project Overview
This project builds a machine learning model to predict the probability of loan default using financial and behavioral customer data.

Dataset: Kaggle – Give Me Some Credit (2011)

---

## Problem Statement
Financial institutions must evaluate credit risk before approving loans.  
This project predicts whether a borrower will default within two years based on financial history and repayment behavior.

## Project Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Handling Class Imbalance  
4. Feature Importance Analysis  
5. Model Training (Random Forest, XGBoost)  
6. Model Evaluation (ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall)  
7. Model Saving for Deployment
